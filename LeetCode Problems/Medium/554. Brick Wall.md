### [554. Brick Wall](https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/)
> There is a brick wall in front of you.\
> The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks.The bricks have the same height but different width.\
> You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks.\
> The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. \
> Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.\
> If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. \
> You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.\ 
> You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.\
> \
> Example:\
> Input: [[1,2,2,1],\
>         [3,1,2],\
>         [1,3,2],\
>         [2,4],\
>         [3,1,2],\
>         [1,3,1,1]]\
> Output: 2

**Solution:**

&emsp;&emsp;就是求出在哪个位置竖着切一刀，切断的砖最少，就是用map存储每个位置切一刀，有多少砖不会断开，每个砖的右端点就是不会断开的位置，注意最后一块砖的右端点不能算。
```cpp
int leastBricks(vector<vector<int>>& wall) {
    const int rows = wall.size();
    if(rows == 0) return 0;
    // deduce[i] = j; 表示第i列开一刀，有j行的砖不会断
    unordered_map<int, int> reduce;
    for(auto w : wall){
        int cur = 0;
        // 最后一个位置不能算
        for(int i = 0; i < w.size() - 1; ++i) {
            cur += w[i];
            ++reduce[cur];
        }
    }
    int max_reduce = 0;
    for(auto ite : reduce) max_reduce = max(max_reduce, ite.second);
    return rows - max_reduce;
}
```
