### [1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/description/)

> Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.\
> \
> Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1&emsp; Output: 4\
> Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].\
> \
> Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1&emsp; Output: 1\
> Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.\
> \
> Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2&emsp; Output: 4\
> Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].

**Solution:**

&emsp;&emsp;用一个map存储每个值为结尾的最长等差数列的长度即可，因为是map所以也不需要考虑负数的问题，而且因为初始化都是自动是0，所以特不需要考虑初始化的问题。

```cpp
int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int d) {
    unordered_map<int,int> mp;
    int res = 1;
    for(const int &i : arr) {
        mp[i] = 1 + mp[i - d];
        res = max(res, mp[i]);
    }
    return res;
}
```
