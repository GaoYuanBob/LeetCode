### [1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/description/)

> You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t. \
> Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.\
> You are also given an integer maxCost.\
> Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of twith a cost less than or equal to maxCost.\
> If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.\
> \
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3&emsp; Output: 3\
> Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.\
> \
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3&emsp; Output: 1\
> Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.\
> \
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0&emsp; Output: 1\
> Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.

```cpp
int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
    int l = 0, remain = maxCost, max_len = 0;
    for(int r = 0; r < s.length(); ++r) {
        remain -= abs(t[r] - s[r]);
        if(remain < 0) {
            remain += abs(t[l] - s[l]);
            ++l;
        }
        max_len = max(max_len, r - l + 1);
    }
    return max_len;
}
```
