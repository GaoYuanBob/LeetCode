### [1219. Path with Maximum Gold](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-gold/description/)

> In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.\
> Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:\
> Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.\
> From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.\
> You can't visit the same cell more than once.\
> Never visit a cell with 0 gold.\
> You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.\
> \
> Input1: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]\
> Output1: 24\
> Explanation:\
> &emsp;&emsp;[[0,6,0],\
> &emsp;&emsp; [5,8,7],\
> &emsp;&emsp; [0,9,0]]\
> Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.\

> Input2: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]\

**Solution:**

&emsp;&emsp;就是一个二维矩阵，0的位置不能走，上下左右都可以移动，问最大值是多少。看到最多25个有值的位置以及长宽都不超过 15，就知道可以直接暴力DFS了。因为grid 值为0 的地方不能走，所以可以修改值为0代替visited矩阵。
```cpp
int max_gold = -1, m = 0, n = 0;
void dfs(int i, int j, int cur, int& max_gold, vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    if(grid[i][j] == 0) return;
    cur += grid[i][j];
    max_gold = max(max_gold, cur);
    const int reserve = grid[i][j];
    grid[i][j] = 0;
    if(i > 0)     dfs(i - 1, j, cur, max_gold, grid);
    if(i < m - 1) dfs(i + 1, j, cur, max_gold, grid);
    if(j > 0)     dfs(i, j - 1, cur, max_gold, grid);
    if(j < n - 1) dfs(i, j + 1, cur, max_gold, grid);
    grid[i][j] = reserve;
}

int getMaximumGold(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
        for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            if(grid[i][j] != 0)
                dfs(i, j, 0, max_gold, grid);
    return max_gold;
}
```
