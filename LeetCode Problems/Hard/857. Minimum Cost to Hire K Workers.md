### [857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/description/)

> There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].\
> Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.\
> When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
> 1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
> 2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
> Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.
> 
> Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2&emsp; Output: 105.00000\
> Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.\
> \
> Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3&emsp; Output: 30.66667\
> Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 

**Solution:**

&emsp;&emsp;要满足的两个条件：
1. K个工人的质量和给他开的工资的比例是相同的。
2. 每个工人都要满足他的最小期望工资。

&emsp;&emsp;这道题是大根堆的问题，我们可以选择 wage / quality 最大的人作为比例，这样能保证K个人中所有人都满足自己的最低工资要求。比例相同的情况下，总的quality越小越海，那么堆顶就是最大的quality，当堆的大小等于 K+1 的时候，将堆顶pop出去，当堆顶大小为K的时候，要计算工资值。
```cpp
double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int> q, vector<int> w, int K) {
    vector<pair<double, int>> workers;
    for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); ++i)
        workers.emplace_back((double)(w[i]) / q[i], q[i]);
    sort(workers.begin(), workers.end());
    double res = DBL_MAX;
    int qsum = 0;
    priority_queue<int> pq;
    for (auto worker : workers) {
        qsum += worker.second;
        pq.push(worker.second);
        if (pq.size() > K) {
            qsum -= pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
        if (pq.size() == K)
            res = min(res, qsum * worker.first);
    }
    return res;
}
```
